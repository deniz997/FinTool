# Mercedes-Benz SDC Financial Planning Tool Project

This project has been implemented for the project course lead by SDC Team from Mercedes-Benz. According to the requirements of the finance department, we have implemented a dummy dashboard UI. We have used CoreUI Pro for Angular2+ which is powered by TypeScript. You can find some example screens from the dashboard. However, dependencies are not maintained anymore.

You can find the project planning and the documentation in the project folder.
